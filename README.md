# CyberBar
It is an app that allows you to input a cocktail name and displays the ingredients and type of cocktail it is. The purpose of this app is to specifically target a directory for cocktails instead of going into a rabbit hole on google.

## Getting Started 
Here is [My Website](https://cyberbar.netlify.app/)

## Future Enhancements
I would like to to create additional section that will allow music playback in the back while using the app. Also, would like to incorporate more information such as, tutorial videos, pictures, ingredients based function that will allow you to search based on specific item used in a cocktail as opposed to just the name of the cocktail. Perhaps even making a drinking game out of it. Styling the app is also something Iâ€™d like to work on to make it more user friendly and visually pleasing.
